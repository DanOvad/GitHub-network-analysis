# README

This project will be focused on collecting data from GitHub API v3. The intention is to create a follower/following network starting off with a specific point of origin. This will be similar to my Youtube Network Analysis repo, except focused on GitHub users. Unlike YouTube, GitHub provides both following and followers. In comparison, YouTube only provides Featured Channels, which can somewhat be considered a channels list of channels that they are "following". 

Since an individuals personal GitHub does not encompass all of a developers contributions, this isn't intended for any rigorous analysis of the GitHub community. It's simply a means to explore users and potentially find distinct communities or fellow users with similar content or interests.
